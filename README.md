Le technical stuff
-------------------

  * *Fully* front-end.
  * Exports images to [imgur](http://imgur.com)
  * I discovered that embedding a large base64 image (>1.5MB) makes the browser behave weird. e.g when you try to drag the image, it crashes the browser and you can't right  click>save as. Therefore I converted the images into blobs. BOOM.
  * I'd recommend you to use Google Chrome. If you want to use Firefox, please do [this](http://www.browsomatic.com/2012/07/firefox-16-now-supports-html5.html)
